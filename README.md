# Remap-Loom

In order to support multiple versions of the game, we created Remap-Loom, which is a Gradle
Plugin specifically made for the purpose of being able to compile for a certain version of the game.
This Gradle Plugin is less complex compared to Jonas Hertigz's Preprocessor, but is more advanced 
than the Architectury Loom. 

This is meant to replicate preprocessor, while also replicating Arch-loom at the same time. This is also
meant to provide first-hand support for Quilt, which is a fork of Fabric.
