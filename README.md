# Remap-Loom
Remaps loom to make it compatible with the Forge modloader and Fabric.

This is a complete rewrite of what the original loom is, providing first hand support for the Quilt
platform. It also provides support for the Forge platform. 

This project was inspired by the creators of Kord, as well as Fabric's loom.
