# Projects
Within this folder, you can see two folders. 

(Forge)[https://github.com/isolysm/Remap-Loom/tree/main/project/forge] holds the necessary tools to help Forge. It is meant to act as a replacement for legacy versions of ForgeGradle.

(Fabric)[https://github.com/isolysm/Remap-Loom/tree/main/project/fabric] holds a modified version of loom, which can support the stuff that we added.
